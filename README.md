1. Iris Dataset Prediction
The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes. The dataset is included in R base and Python in the machine learning package Scikit-learn, so that users can access it without having to find a source for it. Several versions of the dataset have been published.
We will use Decision trees as it tends to be the method of choice for predictive modeling because they are relatively easy to understand and are also very effective. The basic goal of a decision tree is to split a population of data into smaller segments. A regression tree is used to predict continuous quantitative data. Which will help to predict the # classes of Iris Dataset.
